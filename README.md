# slg-project
First project from the Scala Learning Group


This is a project that aims make new developers familiar with some scala concepts. 

The idea of this training is to reproduce the DIF structure step by step so it can be understood better not only in an architectural sense but also in a scala sense.

For our project let's create a scala project that reproduces the same idea as the DIF repo: a ETL process with more than one Origin and Destination that can clean and transform the data.
